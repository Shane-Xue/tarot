塔罗抽卡器

## Design details
Numbers range from 0~77. (for the sake of the random algorithm)
Major arcana cards are arranged in number order, starting with 0 (the fool) and ending with 21 (The World).
They occupy numbers 0~21.
Minor arcana cards are arranged in the order of: Wands, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles.
Each set is in turn arranged from 1~10, Page, Knight, Queen and King.
They occupy places 22~77.

We will add pictures of the card later on but now it will be replaced by numbers and the outlines of a card.
